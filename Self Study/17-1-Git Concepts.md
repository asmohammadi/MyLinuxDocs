# Git Concepts:


1. `Git Levels (Configuration Levels)` :  Git has three configuration levels: system, global, and local. Each determines the scope of settings (system-wide, user-wide, or repository-specific).
2. `Repository (Repo)` :  A storage where your project’s files and the full history of changes (commits, branches, tags) are kept.
3. `Working Directory (Working Tree)` : The directory where you modify, create, or delete project files before staging and committing them.
4. `Staging Area (Index)` : A temporary area where you place changes before committing them to the repository.
5. `Commit` : A snapshot of the project at a specific time, including metadata like author, date, and message.
6. `Branch` : A parallel line of development that lets you work on features or fixes without affecting the main project history.
7. `Main/Master Branch` : The default branch that typically contains production-ready code.
8. `HEAD` : A reference to the current branch or commit you are working on.
9. `Tag` : A reference to a specific commit, often used for marking releases (e.g., v1.0.0).
10. `Remote` : A reference to a repository hosted elsewhere (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
11. `Clone` : Making a copy of an existing remote repository onto your local machine.
12. `Pull` : Fetching and merging changes from a remote repository into your local branch.
13. `Push` : Sending your local commits to a remote repository.
14. `Merge` : Combining changes from one branch into another.
15. `Rebase` : Rewriting/Reapplying commits from one branch on top of another for a cleaner history.
16. `Conflict` : When Git can’t automatically merge changes from different commits; requires manual resolution.
17. `.gitignore` : A file listing patterns of files/directories Git should ignore (not track).
18. `Fork` : Creating your own copy of someone else’s repository on a remote server (e.g., GitHub) to work independently.
19. `Diff` : A comparison between different states of files, showing what has changed.
20. `Log` : A record of commits in the repository, showing messages, authors, and timestamps.
21. `Stash` : Temporarily saving uncommitted changes to return to them later.
22. `Workflow` : The process of how branches, commits, merges, and remotes are used together in development.
